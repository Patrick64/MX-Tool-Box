MX-Tool-Box
===========
Version: 1.2.1


This ExpressionEngine addon seems to have disappeared, perhaps due to lack of time to support it. Since it's on the MIT license I'm releasing it here for all to use.


The MX Tool Box is a suite of light developerâ€™s tools which can make your work with EE a litte bit easier or/and faster. At this moment the box has tools for cloning/ordering/export/import fields.

Many thanks to the original developer: Max Lazar http://www.eec.ms/
